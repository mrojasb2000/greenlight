# Greenlight RESTful API

## Skeleton structure for our project

* The **bin** directory will contain out compiled application binaries, ready for deployment to a production server.

* The **cmd/api** directory will contain the application-specific code for our Greenlight API application.

* The **internal** directory will contain various ancillary packages used by out API. It will contain the code for interacting with our database, doing data validation, sending emails and so on. Basically, any code which isn't application-specific and can potentially be reused will live in here.

* The **migrations** directory will contain the SQL migration files for our database.

* The **remote** directory will contain the configuration files and setup scripts for our production server.

* The **go.mod** file will declare out project depencies, versions and module path.

* The **Makefile** will contain recipes for automating common administrative tasks - like auditing our Go code, building binaries, and executing database migrations.

## Running application
For running application open terminal use the go run command to compile and execute the code in the cmd/api package.
```
$ go run ./cmd/api
Hello World!
```

| GET    | Use for actions that retrieve information only and don't change the state of your application or any data.                                    |
| POST   | Use for non-idempotent actions that modify state. In the context of a REST API, POST is generally used for actions that create a new resource.|
| PUT    | Use for idempotent actions that modify the state of a resource at a specific URL. In the context of a REST API, PUT is generally used for actions that replace or update an existing resource. |
| PATCH  | Use for actions that partially update a resource at a specific URL. It's OK for the action to be either idempotent or non-idempotent. |
| DELETE | Use for actions that delete a resource at a specific URL. |

## Get allowed HTTP method supported
You can make an OPTIONS request to a specific URL and httprouter will send back a response with an Allowed header detailing the supported HTTP methods.

```
curl -i -X OPTIONS localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck/

## Live reloading Go application

Install gin is a simple command line utility for live-reloading Go web applications. Just run gin in your app directory and your web app will be served with gin as a proxy. gin will automatically recompile your code when it detects a change. Your app will be restarted the next time it receives an HTTP request.

### How to install
```
$ go get https://github.com/codegangsta/gin
```

### Basic usage
```
Options:
    --laddr value, -l value       listening address for the proxy server
   --port value, -p value        port for the proxy server (default: 3000)
   --appPort value, -a value     port for the Go web server (default: 3001)
   --bin value, -b value         name of generated binary file (default: "gin-bin")
   --path value, -t value        Path to watch files from (default: ".")
   --build value, -d value       Path to build files from (defaults to same value as --path)
   --excludeDir value, -x value  Relative directories to exclude
   --immediate, -i               run the server immediately after it's built
   --all                         reloads whenever any file changes, as opposed to reloading only on .go file change
   --godep, -g                   use godep when building
   --buildArgs value             Additional go build arguments
   --certFile value              TLS Certificate
   --keyFile value               TLS Certificate Key
   --logPrefix value             Setup custom log prefix
